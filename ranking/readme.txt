Each folder represent a usecase for the model. We duplicate the R codes for each usecase for convenience. Each folder should contain "training.R" and "apply.R". The model needs to be trained with "training.R" before predicting with "apply.R".



--------MODEL TRAINING--------

To train a model, save the training data as a csv file, then go to the file in terminal and run the following:

> Rscript training.R <name-of-training-csv>.csv

"logit.rda" should be generated by the training data. This is the model.


*** csv ***
The csv file expect the following attributes:
admit,top100u,comp-rel-maj,worked-it-consult,worked-in-house,mbti.e,mbti.n,mbti.t,mbti.j




-------MODEL APPLICATION-------

To apply, save the candidates' data as a csv, then run the following in the terminal:

> Rscript apply.R <name-of-data-csv>.csv

<name-of-data-csv>-sorted.csv will be returned in the system.

The file contains the candidates' data, in decending order of likelihood to be hired.


*** csv ***
The csv file expect the following attributes:
top100u,comp-rel-maj,worked-it-consult,worked-in-house,mbti.e,mbti.n,mbti.t,mbti.j

extra attributes can be added for your use.
